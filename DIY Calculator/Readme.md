# DIY Arduino Calculator (Tinkercad Simulation)

This is a simple **DIY Calculator** project built using **Arduino**, a **4x4 Keypad**, and a **16x2 LCD Display**. The project was designed and simulated using **Tinkercad**, making it a great starting point for beginners in electronics, Arduino programming, or those exploring circuit simulations online.

## 🔧 Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: **Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (×), Division (÷)**
- User-friendly interface using a 4x4 Keypad
- Real-time result display on 16x2 LCD
- Compact and efficient code using standard Arduino libraries

## 🧰 Components Used

- Arduino Uno R3
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad
- 16x2 LCD Display (with I2C or standard wiring)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- (Optional) Resistors and potentiometer (for LCD contrast)

## 🖥️ Tinkercad Simulation

This project was created and tested on [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits), allowing anyone to view, modify, and run the simulation online without needing any physical hardware.

## 📁 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the `.ino` Arduino code file
3. Upload it to your Arduino if using real hardware or copy it to the Tinkercad code editor
4. Connect components as shown in the circuit diagram
5. Use the keypad to enter numbers and operators
6. Press `=` to view the result on the LCD

## 🧠 How It Works

- The keypad reads key presses and sends characters to the Arduino
- The Arduino processes the input, stores operands and operators
- On pressing `=`, it evaluates the expression and displays the result
- The LCD displays both inputs and results for easy interaction
